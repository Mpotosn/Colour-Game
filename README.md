# Color Game 
This is a simple color recognition typing game built using Python and Tkinter. The player must type the name of the color in which a word is displayed (not the word itself) within a time limit, testing their focus and reaction speed.

# Features
30-second countdown timer

Score tracking for correct answers

Randomly shuffled colors for each round

Graphical user interface with large colored text prompts

# Requirements
Python 3.x

No additional libraries required beyond Pythonâ€™s standard library.

# How to Play
The game displays a word in a certain color.

Type the color of the text (not the word itself) into the input box.

Press Enter to submit your answer.

If correct, your score increases by 1 and a new word-color pair appears.

You have 30 seconds to score as many points as possible.

The timer and current score are displayed at the top.

# Notes
The game uses the random.shuffle() method to randomize colors each round.

The input must match exactly one of the predefined colors (red, yellow, purple, blue, green, brown).

The game does not currently display a final score once time runs out, but this can be added.
